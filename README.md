# Structure-from-Motion (SfM) Project Report

This report presents the implementation of an incremental Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline to reconstruct 3D geometry from a set of 2D images. Focusing on a progressive approach, the system starts with an initial stereo reconstruction and incrementally adds new views by estimating camera poses and triangulating new 3D points. The Middlebury Temple Ring dataset—comprising 46 pre-calibrated images—was used as the primary benchmark, a custom dataset of a house model was used with 68 images followed by the camera calibration and Lund university dataset of Park Gate of 34 images was used. Core components of the pipeline include feature extraction using SIFT, robust matching with Lowe’s ratio test and RANSAC-based fundamental matrix estimation, camera pose estimation via Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and bundle adjustment for global optimization. Optional colorization of the reconstructed point cloud was also implemented to enhance visual realism. The final model achieved a high-accuracy reconstruction with a mean reprojection error reduced from 2.5 to 0.72 pixels after bundle adjustment, yielding a sparse point cloud of 7,588 points. Visual results, evaluation metrics, and analysis are provided to validate the effectiveness of the pipeline and highlight areas for future enhancement.

## How to Run the Code 


This guide explains how to set up and run the code for **Incremental Structure from Motion (SfM)** to reconstruct a 3D point cloud from 2D images.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** and **Conda** installed. If using your own image dataset, ensure you have checkerboard images for camera calibration.

---

## Environment Setup

### 1. Create a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n sfm_env python=3.10
conda activate sfm_env
```

A conda environment export is also uploaded

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python open3d matplotlib scipy imageio
```

```


## Run the Full Pipeline

You can run the pipeline using Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb

```
Or convert and run it as a Python script:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script main.ipynb --output run_pipeline
python run_pipeline.py
```
This will perform the following:

- Load image datasets
- Perform camera calibration (if enabled)
- Extract and match features
- Reconstruct 3D structure
- Optimize using bundle adjustment
- Save visualizations and outputs to /outputs

## Runing of Different Datasets

To run the SFM pipeline on different datasets: "Temple Ring, House and Park Gate" change the dataset_path in the main jupyter notebook cell under the Configuration & Setup cell 

```
dataset_path = './templering'
valid_extensions = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.bmp', '.tiff']
ext = rename_images_sequentially(dataset_path, valid_extensions=valid_extensions)

```

### Future Improvements  
1. **Loop Closure**: Integrate g2o/Ceres for global BA with loop detection.  
2. **Scale Correction**: Use IMU data or semantic priors to resolve scale drift.  
3. **Multi-Scale Processing**: Add image pyramids for better handling of large baselines.  
4. **Real-Time Visualization**: Optimize rendering for large-scale scenes.
